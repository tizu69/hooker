# hooker

A really simple abstraction layer for webhooks that makes them not deletable. Won't stay up forever.

## Do stuff yourself

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To change references:

- Rename all mentions of `https://hooker.serveo.net` with your own URL

To run:

```bash
bun run index.tsx
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.29. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
